Thanks for visiting Florescence Flowers!

Florescence Flowers is an ecommerce florist website. Users are able to purchase gorgeous bouquets online and get them delivered straight to their door.
Users are able to follow the four basic CRUD functions, Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This means that you can register an account, write user reviews,
add user ratings, view other's reviews / ratings, edit your reviews / ratings, and delete your reviews / ratings. On top of this the user is able to add / 
remove products to a shopping basket and securely checkout using the Stripe payment processing software and application programming interface.

Florescence Flowers is intended to provide great value to those who seek that special gift, for any occasion. The idea for Florescence Flowers originated 
from my love of plants and flowers. There are many plants and flowers within my household, and no matter what mood you're in, flowers always bring happiness
and joy to those who see and smell them. It is a well known fact that flowers bring cheer to those who're celebrating a special occasion, and flowers bring
comfort to those who're grieving. Flowers are emotionally diverse, they mean something to everybody, and that is why I have chosen to create Florescence Flowers.

Please browse Florescence Flower's catalogue of beautiful bouquets, we hope that you manage to find something gorgeous to satisfy your friends, family, or work colleague! You're able to purchase a bouquet quickly without the need to register an account, but if you do register, you'll be able to leave valuable reviews and ratings. You'll also be able to keep track of your purchases through your very own profile page.

Please note that this website is purely for educational purposes only.
